                    n April 2018 Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group,
                     making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise.
                     Aaron Rodgers has long professed his love for the NBA game and the Milwaukee Bucks.

In fact, he has often used the hashtag #midrange because
he loves that part of the game and has referred to Vlade Divac as one of his favorite players in interviews.

Now, the Green Bay Packers quarterback has a stake in the game.

He was announced Friday as a limited partner in the Bucks'
 ownership group during the team's playoff game against the Celtics at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. 
Rodgers was introduced during the game, where he was seated courtside with girlfriend Danica Patrick 
and Bucks co-owner Wes Edens.
