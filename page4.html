        <p class="content">  The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to <u>1919</u>, and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since <u>1957</u>.

                The Packers are the last of the "small town teams" which were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the <u>1920s and '30s</u>. Founded in <u>1919</u> by Earl "Curly" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between <u>1919 and 1920</u>, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in <u>1921</u>. 
                
                The Packers have won <u>13</u> league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles in addition to four Super Bowl victories. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in <u>1967 and 1968</u> and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) prior to the AFLâ€“NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers' coach Lombardi, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two additional Super Bowl wins came in the <u>1996 and 2010</u> seasons.
